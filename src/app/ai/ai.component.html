              SMS marketing, also known as text message marketing, is a
              marketing strategy that involves sending short text messages to a
              group of recipients with the goal of promoting products, services,
              events, or offers. This marketing method utilizes SMS (Short
              Message Service) technology, which allows businesses to reach
              customers directly on their mobile phones. SMS marketing can be an
              effective way to engage with customers, deliver time-sensitive
              information, and drive sales.

              or goods to other businesses rather than selling directly to
              consumers (B2C - Business-to-Consumer). In a B2B context, the
              customers are other companies, and the transactions typically
              involve larger quantities, longer-term contracts, and specialized
              products or services tailored to the needs of the business buyer.
              B2B interactions are common in various industries, including
              manufacturing, distribution, technology, and services.

              Similar to SMS branding, Email branding refers to the practice of
              customizing and maintaining a consistent and professional visual
              identity for your emails. This visual identity includes elements
              like your company's logo, color scheme, typography, and other

              branding helps your emails stand out, build trust, and reinforce
              your brand identity with your recipients.
