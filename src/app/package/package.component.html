  **Terms of Service and Sale - HighSchool**
  
  **Last Revised: December 22, 2023**
  
  **Terms of Sale and Service**
  
  **Introduction**
  
  Welcome! We are HighSchool, a Delaware corporation, known as "we," "our," or "us." Our mission
  is to redefine how the world connects. We provide Products, Services, and Technologies
  ("Products") that enable Users ("Users") to organize, display, and share information
  with others and third parties ("Services") through our software, mobile application, and
  website (collectively, "Platform").
  
  By submitting an order through the Platform or otherwise ("Order"), you (whether on behalf
  of yourself or an entity you represent) are entering into these Terms of Sale and Service
  ("Terms") with us. You agree to be bound by these Terms and other conditions governing the
  use of our Services, Platform, or the Products offered or sold, such as our Privacy Policy
  and Data Processing Addendum (collectively, "Policies"). If you are under 16, you may not
  use our Platform or Services without parental or guardian permission.
  
  If you disagree with these Terms or our Policies, do not submit an Order or use our
  Platform, Services, or Products.
  
  By agreeing, you confirm that you have the authority to bind yourself and/or the entity
  or company you represent. We may periodically modify these Terms or any Policies at our
  discretion, with the "Last Revised" date indicating such changes.
  
  **Purchase of Products**
  
  (a) When you place an Order, you make an offer to purchase Products according to the
  Order terms, these Terms, and our Policies. An Order is effective upon our acceptance
  or rejection. We may accept or reject Orders at our discretion. Product prices (the
  "Product Purchase Price") are as stated in the Order or, if not in an Order, as
  advertised on our Platform when we accept the Order. Prices exclude taxes; you are
  responsible for such charges.
  
  (b) We select shipment methods and carriers unless specified in the Order. Partial
  shipments are possible at our discretion. You pay for shipped units, including shipping
  and insurance costs unless otherwise stated in the Order.
  
  (c) Products will be delivered to the specified address ("Delivery Point") within a
  reasonable time. Custom Products may have longer processing times. Delivery times are
  estimates, and we are not liable for delays. Title and risk pass upon delivery. If you
  fail to accept delivery, risk passes to you, and we may store the Products at your cost.
  
  (d) Inspect Products within ten (10) days of delivery ("Inspection Period"). Accept or reject
  Nonconforming Products (materially different or defective) during the Inspection Period. If
  notified of Nonconforming Products, ship them to us, and we may replace them.
  
  (e) We warrant Products against significant defects for 1 year ("Warranty Period"). The
  warranty doesn't apply if Products are misused, altered, or used with unauthorized hardware.
  Except for this warranty, we provide no other warranties.
  
  (f) We are not liable for a breach of the warranty unless you give written notice within
  10 days of discovering the defect, allow us to examine the Products, and we verify the
  Nonconforming Products. Remedies for Nonconforming Products are repair, replacement,
  credit, or refund at our discretion.
  
  (g) Your sole remedy for Nonconforming Products is as outlined in Section 2(f).
  
  (h) Changes to Terms in Orders are void unless expressly stated.
  
  **Services**
  
  (a) To use our Services, register and create an account ("Account"). Our Services allow
  Users to create, design, maintain, and share profiles or pages ("Pages"). Subscription
  Levels offer different access levels.
  
  (b) During the Subscription Term, you are granted licensed seats for Services based on
  an accepted Order. Users are responsible for complying with these Terms and our Policies.
  Some Products may require an Account Administrator.
  
  (c) We may establish policies and practices for the Platform, including deleting or
  removing Content, terminating inactive Accounts, or changing Services. Our Services
  may be changed, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
  
  (d) You are responsible for your Account's security. Notify us of any unauthorized
  use promptly. We are not liable for third-party access resulting from your failure
  to comply with these Terms.

   terms are as stated on our Platform or Order.
  
  (c) We may collect payments through third-party processors. By providing payment
  information, you authorize us to charge your payment method for Fees. Failure to
  verify or accept your payment method may result in suspension or cancellation.
  
  (d) Subscription Fees may consist of recurring charges. By choosing a recurring
  payment plan, you acknowledge and accept responsibility for all recurring charges.
  
  (e) We may submit periodic charges without further authorization until notice of
  termination or payment method change is provided. Charges submitted before notice will
  not be affected.

  **HighSchool App Terms of Service**
  
  **1. Account Information and Updates**
  
  (g) You must provide accurate, current, and complete information for your HighSchool
  account. Ensure timely updates for your billing account, including changes to
  billing address, credit card number, or expiration date. Promptly notify us or
  our payment processor about canceled payment methods or potential security breaches.
  Make changes through your account settings. Failure to provide accurate information
  authorizes us to continue charging subscription fees.
  
  **2. Free Trials and Subscriptions**
  
  (h) Free trials for paid subscription levels are offered with specific terms disclosed
   during the offer. Trials are for users without prior paid subscriptions. Obtaining a
  free tier allows one account creation. Non-genuine use may result in standard fees or
   service denial. Acceptance of free trial subscription implies agreement to associated
    fees upon expiration unless canceled.
  
  **3. User-Generated Content**
  
  (a) Users can post content ("Content") on HighSchool. Posted Content is not confidential,
   treated as public information. By posting, users represent having the right to do so
  and grant us a non-exclusive license to use it for platform operation and promotion.
  
  (b) Users warrant that Content doesn't infringe third-party rights. We reserve the
   right to review and may refuse or remove Content violating terms, policies, or
  laws. Prohibited actions include unlawful, harmful, or objectionable Content;
  collecting personal information without consent; creating derivative works; and
  interfering with platform operations.
  
  (c) The platform may contain links to third-party services ("Third Party
  Services"). These services are not covered by our terms, and we are not
  responsible for them.
  
  (d) Platform content is protected by intellectual property laws. All related
  rights are exclusively ours. Users providing feedback grant us rights to use it freely.

  use, negative comments, or third-party information provided without consent. Users are
  responsible for interactions with others; we may not intervene in disputes.
  
  (b) We're not liable for indirect, incidental, or exemplary damages arising from a
   breach of terms, regardless of foreseeability. Our aggregate liability is limited
  to the total amounts paid by you in the previous 12 months.
  
  **5. Indemnification**
  
  Users indemnify us against any losses arising from claims by third parties related to
  platform use, purchased products or services, or user negligence or breach of terms.
  
  **6. Governing Law**
  
  These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Alabama.
  
  **7. Binding Arbitration**
  
  (a) By accepting these terms, you waive the right to a jury trial and class action
  participation. Disputes are resolved through binding arbitration. Some claims are
  exempted, including those regarding intellectual property rights or small claims.
  
  (b) Disputes must be addressed informally for at least 30 days before arbitration.
  If unresolved, either party may elect binding arbitration administered by the
  American Arbitration Association in Birmingham, Alabama.
  
  **8. General**
  
  (a) Unenforceability of one provision won't affect others. In case of conflict,
  we decide which provision prevails. Headings are for convenience. Our
  non-enforcement doesn't waive future enforcement rights.
  
  (b) Products and services may be subject to US export control laws. Users
   are responsible for compliance. Communication with us is electronic,
   fulfilling legal requirements.
  
  (c) Notices are provided within the platform or through services. Users
    can notify us via mail.
  
  (d) "Include" or "including" is not limiting, and "or" means "and/or."
